We collaborated on an engineering design project focused on mitigating the impact of Spotted Lanternflies (SLFs) on grape production. Our team, *Grape Guardians*, saught to address the increasing economic and agricultural damage caused by SLFs in vineyards.

We developed an idea of a  perimeter-based light trap system designed to attract SLFs away from grapevines, preventing infestation before harvest. Conducted background research on SLF behavior, population density, and projected economic impact, using data-driven analysis to justify a preventative design approach rather than post-harvest separation.

We also created an idea of a trapping mechanism incorporating one-way entry to contain insects while minimizing chemical usage and utilizing light. Explored key engineering tradeoffs including light wavelength selection, lumen intensity, environmental impact, and potential effects on beneficial insect populations. Proposed controlled experiments to test SLF attraction rates during day vs. night conditions and assess trap efficiency.

This project required systems-level thinking, research synthesis, risk assessment, and sustainable design principles to propose ideas for a unique but simple solution.
