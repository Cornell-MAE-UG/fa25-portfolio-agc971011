We collaborated on an engineering design project focused on mitigating the impact of Spotted Lanternflies (SLFs) on grape production. Our team, *Grape Guardians*, saught to address the increasing economic and agricultural damage caused by SLFs in vineyards.

We developed an idea of a perimeter-based light trap system designed to attract SLFs away from grapevines, preventing infestation before harvest. Conducted background research on SLF behavior, population density, and projected economic impact, using data-driven analysis to justify a preventative design approach rather than post-harvest separation. The trapping mechanism would incorporate one-way entry to contain insects while minimizing chemical usage and utilizing light.

This project required systems-level thinking, research synthesis, risk assessment, and sustainable design principles to propose ideas for a unique but simple solution.
