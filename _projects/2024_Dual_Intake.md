Developed and prototyped a dual ring intake mechanism for the FIRST Robotics Competition 2024 robot, tailored for efficient ring collection and transfer to the shooter system. Led the entire design process in CAD, iterating intake wheel dimensions to optimize ring alignment, durability, and lifespan. Collaborated closely with electrical, coding, and manufacturing sub-teams to ensure seamless integration and functional reliabilityâ€”resulting in a system that withstood competition stresses without failure. Engineered custom gear ratios and refined component geometry for precise vectoring, successfully channeling rings upward from ground intake to the shooter. This project required rapid prototyping, creative problem-solving, and effective cross-disciplinary teamwork
