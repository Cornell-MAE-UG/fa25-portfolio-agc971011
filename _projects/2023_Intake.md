Designed and engineered an articulated intake system for the 2023 FIRST Robotics Competition robot, focused on reliable acquisition and transfer of game objects to the main robot chassis. Developed the design from concept through CAD modeling, optimizing arm geometry and roller placement to maximize collection efficiency and minimize weight. Integrated a custom linkage and pneumatic actuator for robust deployment, collaborating across teams for optimized fit and manufacturability. Prototyped multiple roller configurations to ensure consistent object capture and durability during matches. Coordinated with electrical and programming teams for seamless actuator control and system reliability. The intake performed consistently throughout the season, demonstrating effective teamwork, rapid iteration, and practical engineering
